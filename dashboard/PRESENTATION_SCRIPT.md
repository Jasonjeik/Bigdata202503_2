## Minute 1: Introduction & Problem (60 seconds)

**[Show Home Page]**

"Good [morning/afternoon]. Today I'm presenting our Movie Sentiment Analytics Platform - 
a real-time solution that transforms how businesses understand their audience's feelings 
about movies.

**The Problem**: Traditional movie feedback is either:
- Too slow (post-screening surveys)
- Too simple (star ratings only)
- Not actionable (no sentiment insights)

**Our Solution**: Real-time sentiment analysis powered by 4 advanced AI models, 
giving you instant, detailed insights into audience opinions."

**[Key Stats on Screen]**:
- 4 AI models with up to 91.6% accuracy
- Real-time analysis in milliseconds
- Visual, interactive dashboard

If no one scans QR:
- Use your prepared sample reviews
- Show the model comparison extensively
- Emphasize how it would work with larger audiences

If too much time:
- Expand on model technical details
- Show more visualizations
- Discuss scalability and security

If too little time:
- Skip detailed model comparison
- Focus on business value
- Show only key visualizations

## Q&A Preparation

**Expected Questions:**

**Q: "How accurate is the sentiment analysis?"**
A: "Our best model, DistilBERT, achieves 91.6% accuracy. We use multiple models 
to ensure reliability, and you can see them agree or disagree in real-time."

**Q: "How does this scale?"**
A: "Built on MongoDB Atlas and cloud infrastructure, it scales automatically. 
We can handle thousands of concurrent users without degradation."

**Q: "What about data privacy?"**
A: "All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We can deploy on-premise 
for sensitive applications. User data can be anonymized."

**Q: "How long did this take to build?"**
A: "The ML models were trained over several weeks using IMDB dataset with 
50,000 reviews. The platform itself took [X] weeks to develop."

**Q: "Can it work with other content types?"**
A: "Absolutely! The sentiment models work with any text - product reviews, 
social media, customer feedback, etc."

**Q: "What's the cost?"**
A: "Pricing depends on scale and requirements. For a proof of concept, 
we can start with [specific offer]. Let's discuss your specific needs."
